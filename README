hyg-usb_firmware
================

hyg_usb is a Temperature and Hygrometry USB sensor based on a PIC 16F1455 
with a SI7021 ( see http://www.macareux-labs.com for details and schematics )

It comes with this firmware ( a simple USB stack in C ) preinstalled so you can
start using it with a cli interface.

But above all, it's a sensor you can HACK with just a pic programmer such as 
pickit2 or pickit3. We hope you'll find this useful : have fun !!!
